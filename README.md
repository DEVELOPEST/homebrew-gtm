### Brew formula for installing GTM

Git Time Metric (GTM) is a tool to automatically track time spent reading and working on code that you store in a Git repository. By installing GTM and using the plugin for your editor, you can immediately realize better insight into how you are spending your time and on what files.

## Homebrew or Linuxbrew

To download GTM via Hombrew or Linuxbrew, you need to enter these two commands:

**Tap:**
`brew tap developest/gtm`

**Install:**
`brew install gtm`

Check out the main [GTM repository](https://github.com/DEVELOPEST/gtm-core) for more information.
